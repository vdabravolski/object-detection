# Object Detection Overview

Object detection is a set of tasks and technique in computer vision. Popular object detection problems may inlcude one or combination of following tasks:
* object recognition - find and classify object(s) on the image;
* object localization - find object(s) on image and draw bounding box(es);
* object segmentation - find specific pixels associated with object(s).



Please note following considerations:
* in real life production systems, you have to deal with images and videos of varying  quality and formats;
* while video stream can be represented as stream of individual images, and you can apply the same 
* you rarely know number of objects on the image (or whether objects of intersted are )
